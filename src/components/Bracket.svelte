        How to make a bracket dynamically:

        every piece consists of two entries or one if odd number of entries
        we can do one sided bracket pretty easily
        just make random pairs call it round one
        reduce the pairs until there are 7 or 8 pairs
        then change to quarter finals, semi-final, final
